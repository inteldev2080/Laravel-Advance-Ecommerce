## Licence

WebTicker has three kinds of licenses: open-source, commercial, and OEM.


###Open Source License {#open-source}

The open source license is designed for you to use WebTicker to build open source and personal projects. The WebTicker open source license is [GPLv3](https://tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-general-public-license-v3-(gpl-3)#summary). The GPLv3 has many terms, but the most important is how it is sticky when you distribute your work publicly. From the GPL FAQ:

> If you release the modified version to the public in some way, the GPL requires you to make the modified source code available to the program's users, under the GPL.

Releasing your project that uses Packery under the GPLv3, in turn, requires your project to be licensed under the GPLv3. If you are okay with this, feel free to use WebTicker under the GPLv3, without purchasing a commercial license.

###Commercial License {#commercial}

If you want to use WebTicker to develop commercial sites, themes, projects, and applications, the Commercial license is the appropriate license. With this option, your do not need to complicy with the privisions of the GPLv3 License outlined above.

Unless your customers are not developing their own commercial products which use WebTicker, they do not require an additional license.

License options are provided on a per-developer basis:

1. WebTicker Commercial Developer License, is for individual developers, each developer requires the purchase of a separate license.
